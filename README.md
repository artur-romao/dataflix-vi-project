# Dataflix
Dataflix is a data visualization application for all movies and series available on Netflix. Shows details about content, such as: age restriction, country of production, year added to Netflix, etc.

Available in: https://artur-romao.github.io/dataflix-vi-project/ (a demo in the deployed project can be done with no problems, except if the page is reloaded, that returns a 404 error, although that doesnâ€™t happen with the localhost project.)
Used dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows 

## How to run
```
cd dataflix
yarn install
yarn start
```
